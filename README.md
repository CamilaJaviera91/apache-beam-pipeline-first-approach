# 🚀 Pipelines (First Approach)

## ➰ What's a pipeline?

✅ Sequence of **data** processing **steps**, where the **output** of one step becomes the **input** for the next. <br>
✅ Commonly used in **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **software development** to automate **workflows** and ensure efficient processing.

## 🅱️ What's Apache-Beam?

✅ **Apache Beam** is a framework for **batch** and **streaming data processing**. <br>
✅ It provides a **unified API** that can run on multiple execution engines. <br>
✅ Works well with **Google Cloud Dataflow**, **Apache Flink**, and **Apache Spark**. <br>
✅ Supports **Python**, **Java**, and **Go** for pipeline development.

# 🛠 Code Explanation - pipeline folder

## 💻 1. pipeline.py

### 👨‍💻 Explanation of the Code:

- This **code** will check if the **'Chins'** field meets the condition:
    - If **'Chins'** is **greater than 10**.
    - It will only display **'True'** or **'False'** if **'Chins'** meets the previous condition."

### 👣 Steps

1️⃣ **Import Libraries:**

- **apache_beam:** Used for building and running data processing pipelines.
- **load_linnerud:** A dataset from scikit-learn containing physiological and exercise data.    
- **pandas:** A powerful data manipulation library for handling structured data.

2️⃣ **Load and Prepare Data:**

- The Linnerud dataset is loaded and converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

3️⃣ **Define the Pipeline:**

- A function run_pipeline is defined to encapsulate the pipeline logic.
- Within this function, a pipeline is created using the with statement, ensuring proper resource management.

4️⃣ **Create PCollection:**

- The 'Chins' column from the DataFrame is converted to a list and then to a PCollection using beam.Create.

5️⃣ **Apply Transformation:**

- The **PCollection** undergoes a transformation where each value is checked to determine if it exceeds 10. This is implemented using **beam.Map** with a **lambda** function for efficiency.

6️⃣ **Output Results:**

The results are printed to the console using **beam.Map(print)**.

7️⃣ **Execute the Pipeline:**

- The **run_pipeline** function is called within the ***if __name__ == '__main__':*** block to ensure the pipeline runs when the script is executed directly.

8️⃣ **Example Output:**

- **Original Dataset**

```
Chins  Situps  Jumps
5      162     60
2      110     60
12     101     101
15     250     80
```

- **Output .csv (Chins > 10)**

```
Chins
False
False
True
True
```
