## What's a pipeline?

âœ…  Sequence of **data** processing **steps**, where the **output** of one step becomes the **input** for the next. <br>
âœ…  Commonly used in **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **software development** to automate **workflows** and ensure efficient processing.

## What's Apache-Beam?

**Apache Beam** is an open-source framework for building batch and streaming data processing pipelines.
<br> <br>
âœ… **Unified Model** â†’ Write a single pipeline for both batch and streaming data.<br>
âœ… **Portable** â†’ Works with multiple processing engines (Spark, Flink, Dataflow).<br>
âœ… **Scalable** â†’ Handles large-scale data efficiently.<br>
âœ… **Flexible APIs** â†’ Supports Python, Java, Go, and SQL.<br>
âœ… **Event-time Processing** â†’ Supports late-arriving data and windowing.
